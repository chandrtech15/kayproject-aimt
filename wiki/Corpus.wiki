#summary This describes the corpus used.

= Installation =

Corpus homepage: http://trec.nist.gov/data/t9_filtering.html

To install, do something like:
{{{
cd <projectdir>/corpus
wget http://trec.nist.gov/data/filtering/t9.filtering.tar.gz
tar xvf t9.filtering.tar.gz
}}}

Then there should be a dir corpus/ohsu-trec, with README etc.
The corpus as such can be found spread over two files: trec9-test/ohsumed.88-91 and trec9-training/ohsumed87.

Run corpus/splitCorpusIntoFiles.sh on one of the ohsumed.`<`year`>` files to split them into separate documents. Each split file will have a filename like ohsumed.`<`year`>`.`<`ID`>` with the following content:

{{{
ID Identifier
Content of file
}}}

Alternatively, use corpus/reduceCorpusToText.sh > outputFile on one of the files to remove all boilerplate information and only leave ID and document content.
