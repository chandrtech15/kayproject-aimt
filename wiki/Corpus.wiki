#summary This describes the corpus used.

= Installation =

Corpus homepage: http://trec.nist.gov/data/t9_filtering.html

To install, do something like:
{{{
cd <projectdir>/corpus
wget http://trec.nist.gov/data/filtering/t9.filtering.tar.gz
tar xvf t9.filtering.tar.gz
}}}

Then there should be a dir corpus/ohsu-trec, with README etc.
The corpus as such is split into three parts: pre-test, training and test. At the beginning, we'd probably like to work with pre-test, to get everything running.

Run corpus/splitCorpusIntoFiles.sh on one of the ohsumed.*<year*> files to split them into separate documents. Each split file will have a filename like corpus*<ID*> with the following content:
